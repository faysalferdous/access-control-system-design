#  Access Control System

> Documentation-focused system design project exploring secure access control, authorization hierarchy, and role-based security models for high-security environments.

---

## 📘 Project Overview

The ** Access Control System** is a documentation-based system design project that outlines how secure access control mechanisms can be structured for high-security environments.

The project emphasizes **authorization logic**, **role-based access control (RBAC)**, **access hierarchy**, and **controlled zone management**, using conceptual and simulated data only.

> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> This repository does **not** contain real-world infrastructure details, operational procedures, or sensitive information.  
> All materials are **generic, simulated, and non-sensitive**.

## 🎯 Objectives

- Design a structured access control model
- Demonstrate role-based authorization concepts
- Define access hierarchy across secure zones
- Present a clear documentation-driven system design
- Provide a reusable reference for academic and portfolio use

## 🧱 System Design Scope

The project conceptually covers:

- Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Authorization workflows
- Secure zone classification
- Permission hierarchy
- Identity verification concepts
- Access decision logic
- Audit and traceability (conceptual)

No implementation code is included in this release.
